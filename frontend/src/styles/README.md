# Styles

Reusable style modules for the frontend.

## status.module.css

Defines `.positive` and `.negative` classes for styling positive or negative values. The colors `#166534` and `#991b1b` meet WCAG AA contrast requirements on white backgrounds. When using these classes, include an additional indicator such as an arrow prefix (e.g., `▲`/`▼`) so status is not conveyed by color alone.
