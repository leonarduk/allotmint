This directory is reserved for QA-generated screenshots that demonstrate page layouts across supported platforms.

During each release cycle, the QA team should capture and commit up-to-date screenshots for every page/platform combination.

If no screenshots are available, leave this `.gitkeep` file in place to retain the directory structure.
